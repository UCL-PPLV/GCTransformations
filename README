Correctness-Preserving GC Transformations
=========================================

This directory contains implementation and (in the future)
formalization of the framework for correctness-preserving derivations
of concurrent garbage collectors by Vechev et al. [VYB06].

The structure of the project:

- ./haskell -- a folder with the Haskell prototype of parametrised
  expose functions. Different dimensions are implemented as type
  classes with mutually-disjoint functions, specifying the
  corresponding partitions.
   |
   
---- GCDerivation.hs -- this file contains implementation of the main
     GC machinery concerning parametrized instances of the explore
     function. The same file also contains definitions of all the
     dimension type classes.
   | 
---- ExampleXY.hs -- example files, corresponding to the case studies
     labelled as X.Y in the [VYB06] paper. The comments after the
     expressions describe the results obtained by evaluating them.

- ./coq -- a Coq formalization of the collector's exposing functions
  and their correctness wrt. graph reachability
   |
---- hgaphs.v -- a theory of object graphs, including facts about
     allocation/mutation.
   |
---- logs.v -- implementation of collector/mutator logs
   |
---- ...



Building the project
====================

-- Haskell --

Run

make clean; make

from the folder "haskell" to compile the project.

Individual example files can be loaded into the ghci REPL as follows

:load ExampleXY.hs

-- Coq --

Run

make clean; make 

from the folder "Coq". This will build the necessary libraries and the
GC formalizaion.
